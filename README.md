### About

An interactive showcase of Zaria Forman's large-scale and photorealistic pastel drawings to explore the beauty and fragility of the earth.

### Background

My favorite projects that I've contributed to were related to art in some fashion. Wishing to continuing that trend, I reached out to my friend Zaria, who's an amazingly talented artist and golden soul to see about collaborating on a project that encourages a different type of interaction with her drawings. Zaria's photorealistic drawings are riddled with intricacies, nooks, and crannies and is the perfect use case for DeepZoom imaging tools like the OpenSeadragon library.

OpenSeadragon is one of those projects that make you want to find _ANY_ reason to use it. Early last year I developed an interactive gallery for Katsushika Hokusai's famous "Thirty-Six View of Mt. Fuji" woodblock prints and was very happy with the development experience. I hope to create something as magical as the Thirty-Six Views working with Zaria and her awe-inspiring drawings.
